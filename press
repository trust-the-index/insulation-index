    <p style="color: #666; font-weight: bold;">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
    <h1>VibrantAndVocal.io Launches "Monoculture Monitor" to Combat National Boredom Epidemic</h1>
    
    <p class="dateline">City of Vibrancy — February 2026</p>

    <p>Today, the developers behind <strong>VibrantAndVocal.io</strong> officially declared war on "The Void," launching a suite of digital tools designed to help citizens escape the stifling grip of performative silence and aggressive neighborhood conformity.</p>

    <p>The launch comes as a direct response to the rise of exclusionary "quiet mapping" tools. VibrantAndVocal.io uses the same high-level demographic and geographic data but applies <strong>Human-First Logic™</strong> to identify where culture is actually happening.</p>

    <p>"For too long, 'Peace and Quiet' has been used as a dog-whistle for social isolation," said the developers. "We aren't looking for a quiet place to nap; we’re looking for a place to live. If your neighborhood has a 0% 'Spice Score,' we consider that a public health emergency."</p>
